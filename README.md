# TRAI Band Spectrum Auction 

This project implements Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) band spectrum auction for different circles across the counrty based on fair band allocation policy as well as keeps track of the usage of radio frequency spectrum, as well as the generations of cellular networks used by Indian telecom users,

1) project repository consist of three branches viz:

main
branch1
branch2

2) main branch resources:

*README file.
*Problem statement.
*csv files: subscribers.csv, spectrumRequest.csv, spectrumRange.csv & MVNOSpectrum.csv

3) branch1 resources:

*part1.cpp: This file contains source code for "Q1 to Q5" in given problem statement.
*Supporting .csv files for running "part1.cpp"
*Empty "Bidding_Report.txt" file to print & store allocation information after every auction.
*makefile for part1.cpp

4) branch2 resources:
   
*part2.cpp: This file contains source code for "Q6" seperately.
*makefile for part2.cpp

5) Notes:

**Usage Density (Î») = No. of bands/No. of users
**Input validy for circle input in "part1.cpp" only valid circle inputs are allowed.
**Report of auction will be generated after execution of part1.cpp in "Bidding_Report.txt" file.
**Usage Density for all of the Telecom Operators is set to "1.65" in part2.cpp can be changed whenever required.
**Classes, inheritance and functions are used whenever rquired.
**Vectors are not used anywhere in programs.
**Sorting algorithm is taken from open source AI, logic for both programs by self.
